# Fake News Detection

## Project Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect fake news from real news. The model is trained using the TF-IDF Vectorizer and Logistic Regression to classify news articles as real or fake.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing (cleaning and text normalization).
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- Machine learning model Logistic Regression.
- Model evaluation using classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## Technologies Used
- Python Programming language.
- Libraries 
  - Pandas Data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy Numerical computations.
  - Scikit-learn Machine learning and model evaluation.
  - SeabornMatplotlib Data visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Fake News Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains news articles with labels indicating whether the news is real or fake.
